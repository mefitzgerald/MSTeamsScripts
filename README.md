# MSTeamsScripts
Helper Scripts to Manage MS Teams. These were created with the goal of easily being able to add and update users and Channels in MSTeams.   
These are suited to my purposes but can be easily adapted for your own uses. **See the wiki for more information**

## AddMembersToTeam
This script as it states adds new members to your team from a csv, which is crucial if you are later adding them to a channel.  

## AddChannelsToTeam
The script can bulk add private Channels to your specified Team from a csv.  

## AddMembersToChannel  
This script adds members to specified channels, as mentioned the members must already be in the team
